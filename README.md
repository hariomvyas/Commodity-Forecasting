# Commodity-Forecasting

To forecast the future price of commodities on the US market using technical analysis indicators, a machine learning model was developed and put into use in this article. For this, data on the commodities Crude Oil, Silver, Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium, and Oil were obtained from several sources that provide real-time data. These data were then cleaned, pre-processed, and divided. Machine learning is employed to do the data perdition and forecast the price of gold for the future from the pre-processed data. However, based on the outcomes, it can be said that the constructed model achieved a good prediction performance for all the examined commodities.
